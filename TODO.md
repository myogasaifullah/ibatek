# TODO: Make Add User and Edit User Buttons Functional with Modals

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Analyze current user.blade.php view and identify modal forms for adding and editing users
- [x] Verify routes/web.php has user resource routes including store and update
- [x] Check UserController.php has store and update methods with validation and user creation/update logic
- [x] Confirm User model has fillable fields for user attributes
- [x] Fix JavaScript inclusion by changing @section('scripts') to @push('scripts') in user.blade.php
- [x] Fix edit button to show modal immediately and populate data asynchronously with error handling
- [x] Ensure edit form submission updates user via AJAX
- [ ] Test modal opening when Add User button is clicked
- [ ] Test form submission via AJAX to create user
- [ ] Test edit button click opens modal with populated data
- [ ] Test edit form submission via AJAX to update user
- [ ] Verify validation errors are displayed in modals
- [ ] Confirm success messages and page reloads after create/update
- [ ] Ensure new/updated users appear in the users table

## Notes
- The modal forms and AJAX submissions are already implemented in user.blade.php
- Backend routes, controller, and model are set up correctly
- Fixed the issue with scripts not loading due to incorrect Blade directive
- Edit functionality includes fetching user data for modal population and updating via AJAX
- Testing may require running the application and checking browser console for errors
